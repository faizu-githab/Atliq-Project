# AtliQ Grands – Hospitality Revenue Intelligence Dashboard

## Business Background

AtliQ Grands is a premium hotel chain operating multiple luxury and business-class properties across major Indian cities. With over two decades in the hospitality sector, the brand has built a strong reputation in the five-star segment.

Recently, the company has experienced a decline in revenue growth and market share due to:

- Aggressive pricing strategies from competitors
- Inconsistent revenue management decisions
- Limited data-driven strategic planning

To address these challenges, the Managing Director decided to adopt a Business Intelligence approach. Since there is no internal analytics team, an external data analyst was hired to transform historical booking and revenue data into actionable insights.
